RushMore Pizza Ordering System – Capstone Project

1. Creative Feature Implemented:
   I added a "Pizza of the Day" feature to the system. When the program runs, it randomly selects one pizza from the menu to be the "Pizza of the Day.
   This pizza gets an additional 25% discount for the entire session, whether ordered by box or by slice.

2. Why I Chose This Feature and How It Improves the Program:
   I selected the "Pizza of the Day" feature because it adds both marketing value and technical complexity. It simulates a real-world promotion,
   encouraging customers to try new items and make larger orders. Technically, it allowed me to practice working with randomness, conditional discounts,
   and enhanced user feedback. It also improves user engagement by adding an element of surprise to each session.

3. How to Access and Use the Feature:
   - When the program starts, it announces the randomly selected "Pizza of the Day."
   - If a user chooses that pizza, a message informs them of the 25% discount.
   - The discount is automatically applied, in addition to any other qualifying discounts (e.g., bulk or slice discounts).
   - Users do not need to take any extra steps — the system applies the discount based on their selection.
